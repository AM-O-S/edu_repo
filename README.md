The idea for this project was to find out what could be possible reasons why graduate teaching students from US colleges have been declining in the last two decades and what could mitigate its impact.

I downloaded a dataset of teaching graduates from 1970 to 2020 from the  National Center for Education Statistics website. I chose this time range but the data excluded years from 1972 to 1974 till 2020 due to how the pandemic affected data collection globally. I filtered down the data down to the population of graduate population in the US to get most sought after courses by students in the US based on their population size. I also took the data of annual wages of teachers compared to other college graduates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics website to assess the state of their pay.
